Installation Guide

1) The source code was completely written using pycharm professional and it is in the python language. 
2) The best way to test the source code and edit it is to download the python files from source code directory and open them using the pycharm or similar type of IDE.
3) After downloading the python files, please make sure that the IDE you are using has a built in library-numpy. 
4) I have only used a single built in library-numpy and rest part of the source code doesn't contain a single library or algorithm taken from outside.

5) After opening the three source code files on your computer, run the 'execute.py' file where you need to give the 
following inputs regarding the Assignment's electric vehicle problem:

Variable         Indicates                      Input type
n                number of vehicles             int
e                distance between the cities    2D list(n*n)-float
k                number of vehicles             int
s_node           sorce node                     1D list(k)-int
d_node           destination node               1D list(k)-int
initial_battery  Initial battery of a vehicle   1D list(k)-float
charging         Charging rate of a station     1D list(n)-float
discharging      Discharging rate of a station  1D list(k)-float
maximum_battery  Maximum battery of a vehicle   1D list(k)-float
speed            average speed of a vehicle     1D list(k)-float

While providing a list as an input, just separate two numbers by a space and while providing a 2D list as an input, just provide the numbers as a single list, 
the reshaping will be done automatically. Please refer the report file in the main for more clarity.

6) The output will contain two components
  (a) The heuristic matrix describing the distance calculated between any two cities.
  (b) The time matrix describing the total time taken by all the vehicles after optimization.
